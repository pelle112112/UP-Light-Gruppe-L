# Nordic Banking System

We are creating a new internal system for a bank, to be used solely by the banks employees across different departments.
The system i supposed to support all the primary parts of the bank and including costumer accounts and loans, arbitrage and provide overviews of the bank's finances. The system will have restrictions dependent on which department the user is associated with, and should include logging to make sure transactions are tracked. The system must take into account that it is a legal requirement in Denmark to report gains/losses, interest attributions and more, to the government tax department. 

As a start we have decided to focus on the functionality of the advisors.
